### Introduction

Some test code hacked out on October 12, 2015 to use a bluetooth [Nyko Kama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyko_Kama) with an Arduino. Requires the [Nunchucky](https://www.adafruit.com/product/345) breakout adapter.

### WIP

This is a work in progress. Nothing is really finished yet, and the code + README will be improved when I work on this project again.
